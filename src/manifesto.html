    <h2>Manifesto for a New Web, 1st Edition</h2>
    <p>
        This is a set of <b>three core commitments</b> derived
        from the practical experiences of the Yesterweb staff after two
        years of community organization. They concentrate what we have
        learned and how we operate into a general template that can be
        applied to any community at a foundational level. We propose these
        commitments as the basis of unity for those individuals or groups
        who wish to move in the same direction, while allowing a diversity
        of focus, interests, and missions. They are neither rules nor
        guidelines: they are expectations that are upheld by all
        participants, to the best of their ability, who believe in
        building a new culture for the web.
    </p>
    <h3>The commitment to social responsibility and
        partisanship:</h3>
    <p>
        Safety and self-defense are a basic necessity of any
        community, which includes the recognition that it is
        impossible to accommodate all people in the same social space
        due to the inevitability of antagonistic beliefs. Diversity of
        opinion is respected up until certain bounds that reflect
        oppressive intentions such as discrimination against age, sex,
        gender, class, nation/race/ethnicity, religion, or disability.
        When these conflicts inevitably appear, the community must
        strive to understand the situation and take the side of the
        oppressed at any cost. In cases where it is ambiguous whether
        the harm is intentional or accidental, an investigation
        through dialogue is necessary to determine malice or
        ignorance, as ignorance can be resolved with education.
    </p>
    <h3>The commitment to collective well-being and personal
        growth:</h3>
    <p>
        Sustainable amounts of selflessness and sacrifice, ideally
        from all individuals, are required to build a healthy
        community. Building and maintaining a new culture requires a
        consistent social effort as well. We should be mindful of
        collective health, taking compassionate consideration of the
        personal growth of everyone (actively or passively) involved
        in any situation. In our communication we should train our
        ability to listen and to empathize, patiently striving for
        unity and dialogue rather than division and debate, and
        approaching conflict with the intention of resolution. It is
        important that the community does not create goals purely out
        of opposition or antagonism toward something, and instead
        works in a positive and creative manner, toward building
        solutions either in individual or collective practice.
    </p>
    <h3>The commitment to rehumanizing social relations and
        reversing the process of social alienation:</h3>
    <p>
        The development of information technology capital has further
        disintegrated our social being, but being social is a mental
        necessity. We are left with the burden of re-learning the way
        we relate to each other and rebuilding our social bonds in a
        way that treats everyone as equals. This includes unlearning
        dehumanizing behaviors such as treating others as potential
        sources of profit/assets or romantic/sexual objects without
        knowledge or consent, and establishing rules to demarcate
        separate spaces in which all participants are aware and do
        consent (if such spaces are deemed necessary by the
        community). We should question the impact of our environment
        on our behavior, and carefully consciensciously transform that
        environments so that a better culture and humanity can
        flourish.
