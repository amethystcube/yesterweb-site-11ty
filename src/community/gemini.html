    <dt>What is Gemini?</dt>
    <dd>
        Gemini is a webspace that uses a protocol other than
        <code>HTTP</code>, the one you are probably most familiar with.
        This means you need a special browser to view websites that use
        it. There are other protocols like Gemini that you may have heard
        of, such as Gopher and Finger. Many refer to these spaces as the
        "smallweb", and essentially are stripped-down text-based websites.
    </dd>
    <dt>What can I do on Gemini?</dt>
    <dd>
        On Gemini, you can create your own text-only website, called a
        <b>capsule</b>. You can put whatever you like on there, and share
        it with others who use Gemini. You can also read other people's
        websites, and 'surf' by clicking links, much like the old web.
    </dd>

    <dt>How can I view Gemini capsules?</dt>
    <dd>
        You will need a Gemini browser.
        <a href="https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange/releases/tag/v1.9.3" target="_blank">Lagrange</a>
        is a popular one avaliable on Linux, Mac, and Windows, but you can
        check out
        <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/clients.html" target="_blank">list of other Gemini clients</a>
        to find one that works for you.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        What if I don't want to install a whole browser just for Gemini?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        You can use a
        <a href="https://yesterweb.org/gemini.html" target="_blank">web proxy</a>
        to view sites or just browse, but you won't be able to edit your
        site this way.
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I make my own Gemini capsule?</dt>
    <dd>
        You can sign up by accessing the following URL from a
        Gemini-compatible browser:
        <code class="url">gemini://cities.yesterweb.org/signup</code>. Enter your
        desired username and password, which you will need to edit your
        site.
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I edit or upload to my Gemini capsule?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            Gemini pages are text files saved with the
            <code>.gmi</code> extension. You can upload your files using a
            browser at
            <code class="url">gemini://cities.yesterweb.org/filemanager</code>.
            Otherwise, you'll need file management program with WebDAV
            support. Some recommendations are
            <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/index.php" target="_blank">WinSCP</a>
            or
            <a href="https://www.putty.org/" target="_blank">PuTTY</a> for
            Windows. If you're on Mac or Linux, you can make a connection to
            the server right from your file manager:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux: <code>File > Connect to Server</code></li>
            <li>Mac: <code>Go > Connect to Server</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Read the
            <a href="https://gemini.yesterweb.org/welcome.gmi" target="_blank">WebDAV connection instructions</a>
            for the correct hostname and port. Once you make a connection,
            your 'homepage' will be a file named index.gmi. You can create
            folders and more .gmi files as additional pages.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How can I add a guestbook to my Gemini capsule?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            You can use the <code>{{GUESTBOOK}}</code> command to display
            your guestbook comments wherever you like.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, create a link to:
            <code class="url">gemini://cities.yesterweb.org/guestbook/USERNAME</code> making
            sure to replace your username in the link.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How do you format text on Gemini?</dt>
    <dd>
        Gemini formatting is called "gemtext" markup. You can read a
        <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/gemtext.gmi" target="_blank">complete gemtext guide</a>
        or reference the handy guide below.
